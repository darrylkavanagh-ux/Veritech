# CVK 1100 Truth Engine

**Copyright © 2026 Orb AI Limited. All Rights Reserved.**

## Overview

The CVK 1100 Truth Engine is the verification core of the VeriTech platform. It takes all known facts—from cave carvings to modern databases—and determines what is **REAL**, **TRUE**, and **NEEDED**.

## Core Philosophy

> "Takes all of the known facts known to man - from cave carvings to modern databases. It takes everything that is written, everything that is known about something. It then extracts what is REAL, what is TRUE, and what is NEEDED."

## Verification Process

### Stage 1: Reality Checks
- Source existence verification
- Content substantiveness
- Temporal validity
- Provenance chain verification
- Physical/digital existence confirmation

### Stage 2: Truth Checks
- Internal consistency
- External corroboration
- Temporal consistency
- Jurisdictional validity
- Source reliability

### Stage 3: Necessity Checks
- Case type relevance
- Actionable intelligence assessment
- Evidence gap filling
- Legal requirement alignment
- Investigation priority

## 10-Level Verification Standard

| Level | Classification | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Automated | Basic verification checks |
| 4-6 | Enhanced | Cross-referencing and validation |
| 7-10 | **Human-in-the-Loop** | MANDATORY human review |

## Source Types Supported

The CVK 1100 engine processes information from all human knowledge sources:

1. **Ancient Sources**
   - Cave carvings
   - Ancient manuscripts
   - Historical archives
   - Oral traditions

2. **Traditional Sources**
   - Written records
   - Legal documents
   - Financial records

3. **Modern Sources**
   - Government databases
   - Corporate records
   - Digital traces
   - Witness statements
   - Physical evidence
   - Scientific analysis
   - Surveillance data
   - Communication intercepts
   - OSINT collections

## Output

Verified inputs are converted to **Truth Fragments** and passed to the Jigsaw Protocol for reconstruction.

## Human-in-the-Loop

**MANDATORY for Level 7+ verifications.**

The CVK 1100 engine enforces human review for:
- High-stakes verifications
- Anomaly detection triggers
- Cross-reference conflicts
- Court-ready evidence

## Integration

```typescript
import { CVK1100Engine } from './cvk-1100';

const engine = new CVK1100Engine();

const result = await engine.processInputs(inputs, caseContext);

// Result contains:
// - verifiedFragments: TruthFragment[]
// - rejectedInputs: RejectedInput[]
// - humanReviewRequired: HumanReviewItem[]
// - verificationSummary: VerificationSummary
```

## Tests

44 comprehensive tests covering:
- Engine initialization
- Input processing
- Reality checks
- Truth checks
- Necessity checks
- Human review requirements
- Source type support
- Verification summary
- Chain of custody
