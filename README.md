## Core Engines

### 1. CVK 1100 Truth Engine

The verification core that takes all known facts—from cave carvings to modern databases—and determines what is **REAL**, **TRUE**, and **NEEDED**.

**Features:**
- 10-Level Verification Standard
- 16 source types (cave carvings to OSINT)
- 5-point reality check system
- Multi-source truth verification
- Necessity assessment with relevance scoring
- **Human-in-the-loop MANDATORY for Level 7+**

**Verification Levels:**
| Level | Classification | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Automated | Basic verification checks |
| 4-6 | Enhanced | Cross-referencing and validation |
| 7-10 | **Human-in-the-Loop** | MANDATORY human review |

**Tests:** 44 passing

### 2. Jigsaw Protocol Engine

The reconstruction engine that **"creates everything that doesn't exist based on everything that exists."**

**Features:**
- Fragment compression into engineered components
- Components only fit ONE way (mathematical certainty)
- Automatic picture assembly
- Gap identification with source suggestions
- Court readiness assessment
- 12 universal case types

**Universal Applications:**
| Case Type | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Missing Person | Reconstruct movements, contacts, patterns |
| Missing Asset | Trace ownership, transfers, locations |
| Hidden Wealth | Map financial networks, shell companies |
| Fraud | Reconstruct scheme timeline, participants |
| Corruption | Map relationships, payments, influence |
| Predatory Lending | Document pattern of behavior |
| Financial Crime | Trace money flows, laundering patterns |
| Identity Theft | Reconstruct theft timeline |
| Money Laundering | Map layering, integration, placement |
| Asset Tracing | Follow money across jurisdictions |
| Witness Protection | Assess threats, map hostile networks |
| Historical Investigation | Reconstruct from fragmentary evidence |

**Tests:** 30 passing

### 3. Combined Engine

Orchestrates CVK 1100 and Jigsaw Protocol into a unified truth reconstruction system.

**Features:**
- Single entry point for complete truth reconstruction
- Combined analysis with key findings
- Evidence chain construction
- Court readiness assessment
- Human review consolidation
- Recommendation generation

### 4. Verification Engine

The original verification system for document authentication.

**Features:**
- Document authenticity validation
- Chain of custody verification
- Legal admissibility assessment
- Court-ready evidence packaging

### 5. Investigation Engine

Intelligence gathering and analysis system with 8 specialist agents across 9 jurisdictions.

**Capabilities:**
- Entity relationship mapping
- Financial trail analysis
- Corporate structure investigation
- Asset discovery
- Witness management
- Evidence chain documentation

**Investigation Protocols:**
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Financial forensics
- Corporate registry analysis
- Property registry searches
- Court record analysis

## Operational Philosophy

### Human-in-the-Loop

All Orb AI systems operate on a **mandatory human-in-the-loop principle**:
- Human beings lead all operations
- AI provides backup and works in partnership
- **Level 7+ verifications REQUIRE human approval**
- All outputs are human-reviewed before delivery

### Quality Standards

All outputs must meet the **VeriTech Standard**:
- Court-admissible evidence quality
- Forensic accountancy methodology for financial assessments
- Legal and regulatory compliance
- Professional documentation standards
