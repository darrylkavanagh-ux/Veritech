## 1. PURPOSE

This document establishes the mandatory qualification requirements for all personnel involved in the verification and investigation processes at Orb AI Limited and its subsidiaries (VeriTech, Kavan AI). Adherence to these standards is critical to ensure all evidence and documentation produced by the Orb AI platform is court-ready and admissible in legal proceedings across multiple jurisdictions.

---

## 2. LEGAL BASIS

The qualification requirements are grounded in established legal principles governing expert testimony and evidence authentication in key jurisdictions.

### 2.1. United States - Federal Rule of Evidence 702

> "A witness who is qualified as an expert by **knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education** may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise..." [1]

This rule establishes a broad basis for qualification, where formal education is not the sole determinant. Verifiable experience and skill are equally valid.

### 2.2. United Kingdom - Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) Part 35

> "Expert evidence shall be restricted to that which is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings." [2]

CPR Part 35 emphasizes that an expert's primary duty is to the court, and their opinion must be confined to matters **within their expertise**. This necessitates a clear delineation of an individual's specific area of competence.

### 2.3. Ireland - Order 39, Rules of the Superior Courts

Similar to the UK, Irish law requires that an expert's evidence be based on their **relevant expertise** and provided in an objective and unbiased manner to assist the court. [3]

## 3. THE TIERED QUALIFICATION SYSTEM

To ensure compliance with these legal standards, Orb AI implements a tiered qualification system. This system dictates who can verify what type of information, and whether cross-sector verification is permissible.

| Verification Type | Required Qualifier | Cross-Sector Allowed? | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Document Authenticity** | Trained VeriTech Operator | **YES** | Based on skill in forensic document examination, not sector-specific knowledge. |
| **Technical Content** | Sector Specialist | **NO** | Requires deep, specific knowledge of the subject matter (e.g., construction, medicine). |
| **Legal Compliance** | Legal Professional | **NO** | Requires qualification as a solicitor or barrister to interpret laws and regulations. |
| **Financial Accuracy** | Qualified Accountant | **NO** | Requires professional accounting certification (e.g., ACA, ACCA, CPA). |
| **Process Verification** | Trained VeriTech Operator | **YES** | Based on knowledge of the VeriTech CVK 1100 protocol, not the content being processed. |

### 3.1. The VeriTech Operator

A **VeriTech Operator** is an individual trained and certified in the CVK 1100 protocol. Their role is crucial for process integrity and document management.

**A VeriTech Operator CAN Verify:**
- That a document exists and appears authentic based on forensic markers.
- That the CVK 1100 protocol was followed correctly at every stage.
- That the chain of custody for a piece of evidence is unbroken.
- That all evidence is correctly logged and indexed in the system.

**A VeriTech Operator CANNOT Verify:**
- The technical accuracy of a structural engineering report.
- The legal validity of a contract clause.
- The compliance of financial statements with accounting standards.

### 3.2. The Sector Specialist

A **Sector Specialist** is an individual with demonstrable expertise in a specific field, as defined by FRE 702 (knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education).

**Verification of Sector Specialists:**
Before a Sector Specialist can be engaged, their qualifications must be verified by a VeriTech Operator. This includes:
- Verifying academic degrees and professional certifications.
- Documenting relevant work experience and training.
- Checking for any disciplinary actions or sanctions from professional bodies.
- Confirming membership in relevant professional organizations.

## 5. COURT-READY DOCUMENTATION PACKAGE

To ensure admissibility, every final verification package must include a comprehensive **Expert Qualifications Dossier**. This dossier will contain:

1.  **Lead VeriTech Operator Certificate:** Proof of training and certification in the CVK 1100 protocol.
2.  **Sector Specialist CV:** A detailed curriculum vitae outlining the specialist's knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education.
3.  **Verification of Credentials:** Evidence that the specialist's qualifications have been independently verified.
4.  **Statement of Independence:** A signed declaration that the specialist's opinion is objective, unbiased, and their primary duty is to the court.
5.  **Methodology Statement:** A clear explanation of the methods used by the specialist to arrive at their conclusions.
