## Overview

This document outlines the standard operational protocol for onboarding new clients to the Kavan AI vulture fund case management service. The workflow is designed to be efficient, professional, and compliant with all regulatory requirements.

---

## Stage 1: Initial Assessment (€200 / £170)

### Step 1: Inquiry Receipt

When a potential client makes contact through the website, WhatsApp, or referral, the following process is initiated.

The intake team records the client's name, contact information, jurisdiction (Ireland, UK, or Spain), and a brief description of their situation. The client is assigned a unique case reference number in the format KAVAN-YYYY-XXXXX.

### Step 2: WhatsApp Group Creation

A dedicated, private WhatsApp group is created for the client. The group name follows the format "[Client Name] - Kavan AI Case [Reference]". The group includes the client, their invited parties (family members, advisors), and the assigned Kavan AI team member.

The following contacts are added based on jurisdiction:

| Region | Contact |
|--------|---------|
| Ireland & Northern Ireland | Derek Dunphy or Richard Kavanagh |
| England, Scotland & Wales | Darryl Kavanagh |

### Step 3: Welcome Message & Checklist

An automated welcome message is posted to the WhatsApp group containing the case reference number, an explanation of the Stage 1 process, a document checklist, payment instructions, and expected timeline.

The document checklist includes loan agreements and mortgage deeds, correspondence from the lender or servicer, court documents (if any), payment history and statements, and any other relevant documentation.

### Step 4: Payment Processing

The client is provided with payment options including bank transfer, PayPal, or card payment. Upon receipt of payment, a confirmation is sent to the WhatsApp group and the case status is updated to "Stage 1 - In Progress".

### Step 5: Document Collection

The client submits documents via the WhatsApp group or secure upload link. Each document is logged with a timestamp, assigned a document ID, and queued for initial review.

### Step 6: Initial Verification

Documents undergo initial verification (Levels 1-3) including format validation and completeness check, basic content review, identification of key parties and dates, and preliminary assessment of case viability.

### Step 7: Assessment Report

A Stage 1 Assessment Report is generated containing case summary, document inventory, preliminary findings, case viability assessment (suitable/not suitable), and recommendations for next steps.

The report is delivered via the WhatsApp group and email. If the case is suitable, the client is offered Stage 2 services.

## Stage 2: Full Service (€2,000 / £1,700)

### Step 1: Stage 2 Engagement

Upon client agreement and payment, the case is escalated to Stage 2. The WhatsApp group is updated with the new status and the full investigation and verification process begins.

### Step 2: Full Document Verification

All documents undergo full verification to Level 10 (CVK 1100 standard). This includes authenticity analysis, chain of custody verification, cross-referencing with registries, and legal admissibility assessment.

### Step 3: Investigation

The Investigation Engine is deployed to conduct entity research and relationship mapping, financial trail analysis, corporate structure investigation, asset discovery (where relevant), and witness identification.

### Step 4: Witness Coordination

Potential witnesses are identified and contacted. Witness statements are drafted and reviewed. Affidavits are prepared for signature. Expert witnesses are engaged where necessary.

### Step 5: Legal Pack Preparation

A comprehensive legal pack is assembled for instructing senior counsel. The pack contains an executive summary, verified document bundle, investigation report, witness statements and affidavits, chronology of events, legal analysis, and VeriTech Level 10 certification.

### Step 6: Delivery

The complete legal pack is delivered to the client via secure download link. A summary is posted to the WhatsApp group. The client is provided with solicitor referral options if needed.

### Step 7: Ongoing Support

The case remains open for questions and clarifications. Updates are provided as new information emerges. The WhatsApp group remains active for the duration of proceedings.
